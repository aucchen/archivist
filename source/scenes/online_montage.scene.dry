CityNet is the beating heart of the city, the online agora where its citizens gather to discuss, debate, and disseminate their opinions or the news of the day. At least, that is theoretically the case.

After the Cataclysm, all communications links outside the city were severed. With its monopoly on data transmission via wired infrastructure, CityNet is all that remains. All user identities are fixed to their "real" names or registered organizations.

What are the headlines of the day?

[? if montage_progress <= 3 : What are the headlines of the day? ?][? if montage_progress > 3 : CityNet has been painful to read ever since the anti-echo-chamber policies following the Uprising blocked the use of filtering systems or private groups. It has only become worse, although for some reason you still feel compelled to read. A compulsion, or a habit. ?]

@cn2_watch_video

You watch the video. It is an elementary school classroom, shot from what seems to be a hidden security camera. The teacher is a well-dressed woman most likely in her late thirties or forties, similar to you. "I am a girl now, but when I was born, they thought I was a boy," she says.

"Sometimes people are different," she continues. "Not everyone is who their parents thought they were when they were born." The students are staring at her. The video cuts off right there.

You knew many persisters, but you did not know her; she must have been stealth in the days before the Uprising.

- @cn2_2: You are pleased to see her.
- @cn2_1: This is your future.

@cn2_2

They have not exterminated all of you yet. There are still more persisters in the woodwork, more women like you hiding out there, surviving. You feel less alone.

@cn2_1

They're talking about *you*, or *people like you*. This is your fate if your gender history is discovered.

From one second of the video, you realize that you knew her. She was a persister, like you.

- @cn3_v: Bella, her name was.

@cn3_v

She was your friend, once, until she started to hate you (there were many such cases). She was a graduate student in history, once. She went to the same doctor as you, once. Like you, she tried to ride out the Uprising in safety rather than take part. And now she's dead and you're somehow still alive.

- @cn3_v2: Keep watching.

@cn3_v2

You keep on watching the video.

Bella is wearing a tiny red dress and high heels and more makeup than you had ever seen on her (she used to call it a tool of the patriarchy). Her screams are screams of anguish, emotional more than physical pain, and her expression is one of betrayal, you imagine. The Guards have their signature boyish smiles (they do not wear respirators as a sign of fearlessness towards the nanoplague), and they easily deflect her flails and kicks as they twist her arms behind her back and push her to the floor. One of them moves to stomp on her head. The video cuts off.

You imagine various scenarios.

- @cn3_1: The Guard was her boyfriend, and she thought he would protect her.
- @cn3_2: Her Guard client was found out by his comrades, and they killed her.
- @cn3_3: Her Guard client decided to kill her for the fun of it.

@cn3_1

Maybe the Guard was her boyfriend. Maybe she thought he would have protected her. Obviously, he didn't. Maybe she even thought he loved her. She was never so naive, but who knows.

Anyway, it doesn't fucking matter. She's dead.

@cn3_2

Men who secretly fuck women like you know what they're looking for, or not looking for. And they're usually not looking for someone of your anatomical configuration. The danger arises when the man's friends discover your history.

Anyway, it doesn't fucking matter. She's dead.

@cn3_3

Bella once said that the sociological role of neowomen was to serve as an acceptable outlet for society to enact its libidinal urges for violence. Or something like that. You don't remember.

Anyway, it doesn't fucking matter. She's dead.
