@who_is

Back when it was still legal, you and K- were married. That was six years ago. She was your first love, or something like that. 

Back when it was still legal, you and K- had a child. It was for his safety that you and K- had separated. That was what you told yourself.

Today she works as a scientist in one of the government labs, and lives with S-, her (and your?) child.

"Hello, Em?"

"Is there a better way we could have gotten back in touch?"

"Sorry, is it wrong that I had to come up with an excuse to see you that I believed you would respond positively to? I didn't know if you still cared about me, so I guessed that you would care about S- more."

"Oh..."

- @talk_to_c: "You talk to C-?"
- @yes_take: "Fine, I can take care of him..."
- @no_take: "I don't know, sorry..."
