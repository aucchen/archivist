*The light outside the window was bright and artificial, emanating from a poor simulacrum of the sun hanging on the metal ceiling above. Rows of green and violet macroalgal trees emulated an ancient streetscape, the scene completed by the humans walking by. It was the equivalent of midday.*

- @listen: Listen.
- @remember: Remember.

*The apartment was poorly soundproofed. The highway rumbled in the distance like a never-ending roll of thunder, while the trolley clanged nearby. Nearer still, there was the sound of ventilation infrastructure. Angry human voices. Pounding on the walls. Not heard were nonhuman animals; there was no need for those anymore.*

- @watch: Watch.
- @remember: Remember.

@remember

*The Archivist remembered. Memories, real and imagined, flowed forth like a wellspring.*

- @10_years_ago: 10 years ago.
- @500_years_ago: 500 years ago.

*The memories blur together in the Archivist's mind, five hundred years of this city's history twisted into one knot of fictitious time. Wars. Cataclysms. Uprisings. The construction and puncture of the dome. Birds falling out of the sky. Coup announcements on the radio. Fires in the streets. Evacuations downwards. Isolated facts resolve themselves without context. There are no more non-human mammals. The surface is irradiated. Population down twenty percent. No entrance or exit.*

And none of this matters.

# animate?

The past does not exist. Only the present is real.

- @no_longer: You are not even an Archivist any more.

@no_longer

You are no longer an Archivist, as of approximately one day ago.

- @out_2: You were laid off.

@out_2

Due to budget cuts, you have been laid off, but in their graciousness, the Archives have decided that you could remain as a freelance contractor, paid piecemeal for the documents that you successfully recover. More pressing than the loss of your dignified title is the loss of income. Your rent is due - $[+ rent +] in five days, and your last paycheck did not arrive. You have exactly $[+ money +] to your name, which also must cover food, medicine, and all other living expenses.

- @recover_data: You make money by recovering data from DNA.

@recover_data

You make money by recovering data from organic storage media. It is a relatively easy job: they send you the raw DNA reads, you use your scripts to convert them to a human-readable format, and then you file them with the Archives. For each file recovered, you are paid some amount of money; the payscale is rather opaque.

- @alternatively: Alternatively, you could beg and cajole people for support...

@alternatively

Alternatively, there are exactly two people whom you can cajole and beg for support. You did not exactly part on the best of terms with either, but perhaps they would be amenable.

- @main: Continue...
