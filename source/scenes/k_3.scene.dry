#automatically go here with the queue after waking up...

# what happens here?

# You take care of S- for a second time.

It is morning, and K- has arrived at your apartment. The $100 has been transferred to your account.

- @k_3_2: "Wow. This is my first time being here," says K-.

@k_3_2

"Wow. This is my first time being here," says K-.

"Oh. Sorry it's such a mess."

"It's fine! What's the floor area?"

"15 square metres."

"Oh. That's pretty small."

"I know."

"It's a lot smaller than my place. At least I have a separate bedroom."

"Oh. Good for you."

K-'s gaze wanders, until it stops at your very interesting collection of pots. From experience you know that your conversation has reached an impasse. One of you has to break it. Meanwhile S- has sat up in bed, rubbing his eyes.

- @wait_for_k: Wait for K- to speak.
- @go_to_school: "So, S-, do you want to go to school now?"

@wait_for_k

"S- has school today," she says. "I don't have work in the day. Mind if I come back here afterwards? We still haven't caught up."

Meanwhile S- has slid off the bed, and has gone to the bathroom.

- @sure_meet: "Sure, let's meet."
- @no_meet: "Sorry, I'm busy..."

@go_to_school

"So, S-, do you want to go to school now?"

He nods, groggily, and slides off the bed, grabbing his clothes before going to the bathroom.

"I don't have work in the day," says K-. "Mind if I come back here afterwards? We still haven't caught up."

- @sure_meet: "Sure, let's meet."
- @i_guess_meet: "I suppose..."
- @no_meet: "Sorry, I'm busy..."


@sure_meet

"Sure, let's meet. Later."

K- makes a thin smile. "That's great."

Once S- is ready, the two of them leave. You are only left alone for approximately 30 minutes before K- returns, during which time you lay on the bed, mind entranced in the past.

- @k_3_meet: K- returns.

@i_guess_meet

"I suppose..."

K- makes a thin smile. "That's great."

Once S- is ready, the two of them leave. You are only left alone for approximately 30 minutes before K- returns, during which time you lay on the bed, mind entranced in the past.

- @k_3_meet: K- returns.


@no_meet

"Sorry, I'm too busy today."

"Oh. That's fine. Just fine I guess."

K- and S- leave. You are left alone, as usual.


@k_3_meet
new-page: true

You do not remember when you gave K- the keys to your apartment, but it was well prior to this encounter. The two of you had set a heartbeat system during your first nanoplague scare, in which if you did not send a message to her for three days, she would go to your apartment and check if you were still alive. That was four years ago. The system was never used.

- @enters_room: She enters your room without knocking.

@enters_room

She enters your room without knocking.

"I'm back."

"I can tell."

She sits on the bed, just barely missing your arm.

"So. How's life?"

- @its_fine: "It's fine."

@why_asking

"Why are you asking?"

"It's something to talk about, I guess." She takes your hand in hers, and begins rubbing it. "What did we even talk about back when we were living together?"

@bored

"Are you bored already?"

She shrugs. Idly she takes your hand in hers, and begins rubbing it. "What did we even talk about back when we were living together?"

"It's fine."

"Still not much for small talk?"

"That's interesting, because I don't either. It's like it all happened in my imagination, like none of it was real." She turns to you. "Was it real?"

"Of course it was real," you say.

"See, I'm just saying things now. I don't know what to talk about either so I'm just rambling on without knowing what I'm even saying. I'm just playing out these parts, like..."

K- stops talking, and moves closer to you.

- @stay_like_this: Stay like this.
- @get_up: Get up.

@stay_like_this
on-arrival: k_romance += 1

You feel no need to move. You feel comfortable, safe. K- holds your hand, every part of her body pressed against yours.

"God, I'm so tired," she says. "I haven't slept at all since getting out of the lab. I haven't slept for 24 hours and I haven't even taken a shower since last week."

- @me_too: "I'm tired too."
- @shower: "Do you want to take a shower?"


@get_up

You force yourself up.

"Hey, don't push me!"

"Sorry... It was too tight back there."

K- chuckles. "Wow. Hey, at least I have the bed to myself now." She stretches out.

"God, I'm so tired," she continues. "I haven't slept at all since getting out of the lab. I haven't slept for 24 hours and I haven't even taken a shower since last week."

"What, ten years ago? That's different. You were doing it not so long ago, here on this bed, correct?"

You nod.

"That's fucking gross."

- @why_hate: "Why do you hate A-?"

@why_hate

"Why do you hate A-?"

"He's a privileged asshole. We were just his little jaunt, like a fucking vacation trip. He could have his fill of debauched fun and meanwhile we're still living the nightmare."

@a_unfair

"That's unfair..."

"What is?"

"She's at risk too if they find out. If they discover these 'jaunts' then it's over for her too..."

"It's fucking not. He's going to be fine. He can just say that you were manipulating him and then it's a perfect defense."

- @she_wont_condemn: "She won't condemn me..."

@she_wont_condemn

"She won't condemn me..."

"Are you sure?"

You shrug.

"Well, whatever."

- @awkward_a: It is extremely awkward in here.

@not_affair

"Not because she's having an extramarital affair?"

"No. I don't really give a fuck." She chuckles. "Besides, she's paying you for all this, right?"

"Right..."

"Hey, good for you. Sorry I can't pay as much. Or like, at all."

- @awkward_a: It is extremely awkward in here.

@hey_money

"Hey, she's giving me money."

"Right. Good for you. Get that fucking bread or whatever. Sorry I can't pay as much. Or like, at all."

- @awkward_a: It is extremely awkward in here.

@awkward_a

The atmosphere on the bed has become extremely awkward. K- is sitting up.

"I'm gonna take a shower," she says. "Wash that fucking A- odor off me."

She does so, without prompting.

- @water_allocation: You wish she wouldn't use up so much of your water allocation.

@water_allocation

Anyway, she showers, dresses, and leaves. You are left alone once more.


@me_too

"I'm tired too," you say.

"How the fuck are you tired? You just sit at home all day."

"The body is a fickle thing."

"Well, whatever... I just want to sleep. Or shower. Speaking of which, do you wish to take a shower together? Solely for the purpose of reducing water consumption. Of course."

"Do you want to take a shower?", you ask.

"What's your water allocation?"

"60 litres per week."

"God, that's a lot. That's not much less than ours. When's the last time you took a shower?"

"Um..." In truth, you do not remember.

"You smell like shit." She gets up off the bed. "Do you wish to take a shower together? Solely for the purpose of reducing water consumption. Of course."

K- shrugs. "Whatever. Stay disgusting. I'm gonna take a shower by myself."

- @rest_in_bed: While she does so, you rest.

@rest_in_bed

While she does so, you rest on the bed. You hear the water splattering. It is loud.

She emerges dressed in your bathrobe. "God, I'm so tired. Do you mind if I take a nap here until it's time to pick up S-?"

You are pressed against the wall, facing her, as she is facing away from you. You cannot help but touch her.

You are facing away from each other, just to make it clear that there are no *implications* from this incident, except for the fact that you are sleeping in the same bed in the first place.

You ended up falling asleep after all. The lights are already dimming, and K- has gotten up and gotten dressed.

"Sorry. I have to pick up S- from school soon. Can we maybe start the heartbeat thing again? Where you called me every day to make sure you're okay?"

"Yeah... I'll try to remember."

"Good. And if you need anything, just let me know. I don't know how much I can do, but I'll try to help. I'm sure S- wouldn't mind."

With that, K- leaves, and you are left alone once more.


@k_leaves

"No, sorry..."

"Well, whatever. I'm gonna take a nap at my place, then," she says, and leaves.



@shower_2

"You remember that I've seen you naked before, right?", says K-. "There's no need to hide yourself."

Your longstanding hatred for your body has evolved into the indifference of pretending it does not exist. Undressing and showering breaks such pretensions. You cannot help but become aware of the fact that you are a physical entity, and even more aware of the toll entropy has taken upon you.

@terrible_s

"I was terrible to S-. I messed up." You explain how you cried, and how it was as if S- parented you more than you parented him.

"I didn't know what I was doing either," says K-. "None of us are born parents. Well, maybe some of us, but certainly not me. I'm still shit at it."

@need_money

"Sorry I have to beg for money."

"Fuck, don't let me make you feel bad about that!"

@idk_sorry

"Everything, I guess."

K- shrugs. "Well, that's not helpful."

- @in_shower: Just get in the shower.

@in_shower

It is cramped. The water is cool. K- is warm. You are back-to-back, her pressed against the door, you pressed against the wall. Surprisingly, the two of you had never showered together before in all your years of dating and marriage.

"Hey, I haven't seen your vagina before," she says, turning around and leaning down. "It looks nice. Congratulations on getting the surgery."

- @thanks_surgery: "Thanks..."
- @surgery: Your surgery was in the weeks prior to the uprising.

@thanks_surgery

"Thanks," you say, because what else are you supposed to say to that?

"Hey, I was just wondering," says K- over the sound of water. "Do you wash inside your vagina? You're not supposed to but I'm not sure if in your case it's..."

- @its_complicated: "It's complicated..." (give the full answer)
- @not_really: "Eh. Not really." (avoid the question)


@surgery

Your surgery was in the weeks prior to the uprising; it is quite likely that yours was the final non-clandestine bottom surgery in the city. Your surgeon, the last one remaining at that time, was executed a week hence. He was a pervert, of course, but not the kind of pervert the fascists accused him of. He styled himself an artist whose medium was the neovagina. In his notes he praised your emaciated figure as a "waifish androgynous specimen", waxing poetic on the things he would do to your body. The other persisters hated him for his bias against fat women, so some saw his death as a perverse cosmic justice.

Fortunately, you did not need revisions.

"Hey, I was just wondering," says K- over the sound of water. "Do you wash inside your vagina? You're not supposed to but I'm not sure if in your case it's..."

# does em clean her vagina? Or is it better for the microbiotic environment if she doesn't?
# hmm... (goes on wild research tangent about neovagina cleaning and whether some are self-cleaning and it turns out the evidence and anecdata are mixed (bc in trans studies anecdata is basically as good as the average scientific study due to small n and samples of convenience not to mention often researcher bias))

@its_complicated

"Well, it's complicated. Um, there are mixed reports on whether neovaginas can be self-cleaning or self-lubricating and on how the microbiome of the neovagina compares to a natal one. It depends on the surgical technique and a host of factors. Most of us use cleaning solutions but, um, personally I don't. I like microbes. So I just let them grow naturally. Maybe there's a dataset down there."

K- begins to laugh. "My God. No wonder you never bathe. It must be like a fucking historicide every time you shower." Then she starts to cough up water. "God, I'm choking!"

"I'm sorry. Do you need help?"

"No! I'm just..."

She is wheezing, and pounding on the door awfully hard.

You just stay silent. K- has fallen asleep. You are falling asleep.

K- is already dressed when you wake up. "Sorry. I have to pick up S- from school soon. Can we maybe start the heartbeat thing again? Where you called me every day to make sure you're okay?"

"Yeah... I'll try to remember."

"Good. And if you need anything, just let me know. I don't know how much I can do, but I'll try to help. I'm sure S- wouldn't mind."

With that, K- leaves, and you are left alone once more.
