@ask_k
subtitle: Would she share?
view-if: k_path >= 3
max-visits: 1

Like you, she has a prescription for "early menopause", although the justification of her prescription is more conventional.

Would she be willing to share, though?

- @ask_k_2: Ask her.
- @med_options: Do something else.

@ask_k_2

You make the call.

"Look, I barely have enough for myself. Sorry, but I don't have anything to spare right now."

- @buy: Refill at the pharmacy.
- @none: Go without.


@ask_a
subtitle: Would she be willing?
view-if: a_path >= 2

A- is a doctor. She likely has access to medicine.

- @ask_a_2: Ask her.
- @med_options: Do something else.

@ask_a_2
on-arrival: money += 50

You make the call.

"Sorry, it's a controlled substance so I can't just grab some, but I can give you money to buy your prescription. Is that okay?"

"Sure..."

A- has given you $50.

- @buy: Refill at the pharmacy.
- @none: Don't bother. Just go without.


@none
subtitle: You will be fine, probably.

Fortunately, you have already undergone bottom surgery, so you are unlikely to experience physical masculinization. Unfortunately, hormone deprivation increases the risk of osteoporosis, and it seems to have the effect of making you feel worse in various difficult-to-describe ways that physicians do not acknowledge. And there are the medications for dealing with your persistent nanoplague symptoms that you still need to pick up.

No matter. You will live.

The pharmacy is combined with the grocery store. It is a relatively easy trip. You go there, pick up your prescription and some OTCs, and leave.

There are shortages at the pharmacy. Your prescription hormones are out; all they can give you are some substances that are supposed to be a substitute, but are much less effective and more likely to cause harmful side effects. They are the same price, of course.
