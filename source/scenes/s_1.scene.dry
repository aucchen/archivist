# herein you take care of S-.

You are home again, and it is the first time someone besides yourself has visited in over a year. That time was inspection.

"Sorry this is so messy..."

"Don't worry. Mom is messy too."

S- paces your tiny apartment. it takes about 8 of his small steps to walk from one end to the other.

He looks up at you, as if expecting something.

- @no_idea: You have no idea what to do.

@no_idea

Half-forgotten memories of his first few years float through your mind. But those years were nothing like now. He is older. He is conscious and can think and can judge and will remember all the ways in which you have failed and will fail him.

- @not_parent: You are not cut out to be a parent.
- @one_night: It is just for one night.
- @maybe_fine: Maybe... maybe it will turn out fine.

@not_parent
go-to: s_hungry

Women are supposed to have maternal instincts. Women (GNT women, not that anyone would use the term) are supposed to instinctively know what to do when faced with their long-separated child of 7 years who has been suddenly dropped on them with barely a warning. How can you be allowed to be a woman like this?

@one_night
go-to: s_hungry

It is just for a single night. 

@maybe_fine
go-to: s_hungry

Maybe it will turn out fine.


@s_hungry

# instead of burgers... maybe the food is something else? pockets? 

"I'm hungry," he says. "Can we get burgers?"

Burgers are not a part of your typical diet; your typical meals consist of rice and beans porridge. But perhaps you could visit a restaurant.

- @food_home: "We have food at home."
- @no_food_no_money: "We do not have food at home, and we do not have enough money to go out to eat."
- @go_burgers: "Alright. Let's go."
- @why_burgers: "Why do you want burgers?"
- @burgers_propaganda: "The humble so-called 'burger' is a piece of the Ruling Party's propaganda campaign to legitimize their rule via continuity with the American Empire."

"The humble so-called 'burger' is a piece of the Ruling Party's propaganda campaign to legitimize their rule via continuity with the American Empire."

"What?"

"Oh, um... sorry. I was talking to myself."

"Aren't you a grown-up?"

"Supposedly."

"Wow."

Great. He thinks you're a loser. An accurate assessment, but a painful one nevertheless.

- @food_home: "We have food at home."
- @no_food_no_money: "We do not have food at home, and we do not have enough money to go out to eat."

go-to: food_home_1 if s1_knows_cook_rice = 1; food_home_2 if s1_knows_cook_rice = 0

"We have food at home," you say, and S- is instantly disappointed.

@food_home_1

"Alright. Fine." He goes back to sitting on the bed, but not before taking a random book from your bookshelf.

- @begin_cooking: Begin cooking.

@food_home_2
on-arrival: s1_knows_cook_rice = 1

"Can we still go get burgers?", he asks. "I never get to go out. Mom just makes rice every day."

- @burgers_propaganda: "The humble so-called 'burger' is a piece of the Ruling Party's propaganda campaign to legitimize their rule via continuity with the American Empire."


@every_day

"I cook rice every day too," you say. "Sometimes with beans though."

"Wow. You and mom are like the same person."

"We are, aren't we?" You sigh. S- takes a random book from your shelf and sits back on the bed.

- @gray_mush: "I didn't always eat rice..."
- @mom_taught: "Your mom taught me how to cook rice."

"Well, um, we don't have food at home, and we don't have enough money to go out to eat. So..."

"We can go to our house. We have food there."

WARNING: This route should never be accessible.

@go_burgers
view-if: money >= 30

"Alright. Let's go. To get burgers."

You swallow your small act of legitimizing regime propaganda. It's for S-. It's all for the smile on his face.

- @walking: The nearest restaurant is within walking distance.


@walking

You check your jacket and your mask. The hour is getting late; the lights have turned a dull orange, and there are few people on the streets. S- is holding your hand. You walk quickly, deliberately.

This is not a restaurant you ordinarily visit, due to its high prices and promulgation of regime propaganda. But it is the only burger restaurant within a kilometre of your domicile. Its menu is unfamiliar, a jumble of strange words and anachronistic ingredient names that only have meaning for those born less than 20 years ago or more than 500 years ago - what is the meaning of a "Whopper", exactly? What is a "Mac"? You are partly to blame for this due to your discovery of historical cultural artifacts which then diffused into mainstream consciousness and thus...

"Hey, I'm ready," says S-. "Can we order now?"

Oh. Right. You are here to get food. Burgers.

- @let_s: Get whatever S- is getting.
- @regular_burger: Get the most normal item on the menu.
- @random_burger: Get something random.
- @no_burger: Nothing for you.

@let_s
go-to: order_2
on-arrival: s_1_meal = "kids"; money -= 20; food += 1

S- orders a kid's meal. "Um, two kid's meals," you say. You are worried for a moment, but the server takes your order without a second glance. S- looks at you strangely. It costs $20 in total.

The kid's meal contains one "hamburger", which is a flavored algae patty between two bread buns with some leavy vegetables and unidentified sauces. There is a toy; it's a plastic figure of characters from the most recent iteration of an action movie franchise. You and S- have gotten different characters. You give him yours.


@regular_burger
go-to: order_2
on-arrival: s_1_meal = "burger"; money -= 25; food += 1

You order a "hamburger", which is a flavored algae patty between two bread buns with some leafy vegetables and unidentified sauces, and S- orders a kid's meal, which is the same thing but smaller. It costs $25 in total.


@random_burger
go-to: regular_burger

@no_burger
on-arrival: s_1_meal = "none"; money -= 10

S- orders a kid's meal. "Nothing for me," you say. It costs $10 in total.

S- looks at you. "Are you not hungry?", he asks.

"No, I'm fine," you say, not entirely truthfully.

S- eats outside, as you watch. "I can't eat if you watch me," he says, and you look away.

- @back_home: You go back home.


@order_2

The two of you eat outside. There are few enough people nearby that you feel moderately safe in removing your respirator.

Unfortunately, your burger tastes good. It tastes very good. Whatever synthetic flavorings they added to the algae to make it palatable did their jobs too well. S- downs his burger quickly.

- @back_home: You go back home.


@back_home

"Are you full?", you ask.

"Yeah. What about you?"

[? if s1_meal = "none" : "I'll manage." ?]
[? if s1_meal != "none" : "Yeah. I'm full too." ?]

[? if s1_meal = "none" : "Are you sure? Aren't you going to eat something?" ?]

[? if s1_meal = "none" : "Maybe later." ?]

"Oh. Okay. I have to brush my teeth now."

"Do you have your own things?"

"Yeah. I brought my own toothbrush."

- @hug_s 
- @back_home_2: Why is he so good?

@back_home_2
go-to: bedtime

S- is so *nice*.


@why_burgers

"Why do you want burgers?", you ask.

"Mom just cooks rice every day. I want something new."

- @cook_rice: "I cook rice every day too."

@cook_rice
on-arrival: s1_knows_cook_rice = 1

"I cook rice every day too," you say. "Sometimes with beans though."

@gray_mush

"I didn't always eat rice, actually. I used to eat gray mush all the time when I was your age."

"Gross. That's all they give us at school. It makes me want to throw up."

"Yeah. It is gross. That's all they had at the children's center."

"Sorry. That sucks."

"Yes. It did suck."

- @mom_taught: "Your mom taught me how to cook rice."
- @begin_cooking: Just start cooking.

@mom_taught

"Your mom taught me how to cook rice. I didn't know very much cooking before I met her."

"Wait, aren't you my mom too, technically?"

- @technically: "Technically..."
- @idk_mom: "It's complicated..."
- @trying_mom: "I can try to be..."

@trying_mom
go-to: mom_test

"I can try to be... If you want me to be?"

@mom_test

He crosses his arms. "Hmm... Maybe this is a test. If you pass it you can be my second mom."

"And how would I know if I've passed?"

He shrugs. "I dunno. If I'm not hungry tonight."

"Then I've already failed being my own mom."

"Wow. That's sad."

- @begin_cooking: Begin cooking.
- @go_burgers: "Alright. Let's go get burgers."


@begin_cooking

You fill the pressure cooker pot with rice. There are meats too - mung beans, red beans, and lentils added for extra nutrition and flavoring. K- taught you this. You rinse the mixture until it is no longer cloudy, and fill the pot to the top mark with water. 

"Thirty minutes," you say, turning on the cooker.

Meanwhile S- is sitting on your bed, flipping through the pages of a computer programming textbook.

- @fun_book: "Is this a fun book?"
- @wait_cooking: Wait for the rice to finish.
- @cook_2: Prepare another dish.

@fun_book

"Is this a fun book?"

"Not really."

"Do you want to learn more about computers?"

"I guess. Maybe."

- @teach_s: Teach him?
- @wait_cooking: Wait for the rice to finish.

@teach_s

"Did mom ever teach you any programming? Or school?"

He shakes his head. "They don't teach that until high school."

- @what_grade: "What grade are you in again?" You already know, but it is something to say.
- @lets_start: "Let's start..."

@what_grade

"What grade are you in again?"

"Second. Going to third soon." He stares at you.

- @lets_start: "Let's start."
- @done_rice: Just wait for the rice to be done.


@lets_start

"Let's start..."

You turn on the computer.

- @no_idea_2: You have no idea what you are doing.

@no_idea_2

Theoretically, you should be qualified to teach, given your educational background. However, your mind blanks. You stare at the screen and the blinking cursor.

"Um, hello? Aunt Em?"

"Yeah... Sorry."

- @cry_1: Cry.

@cry_1
on-arrival: s_cry = 1

For whatever reason, you begin to cry. A deeply irrational gesture. You bow your head. Try to hide your face.

"Hey, mama?" Him calling you that just makes you cry harder. He walks to you with a tissue. A waste of perfectly good cellulose.

- @dont_call_me: "Don't call me that."
- @what_: "What?"
- @im_fine_2: "I'm fine."

@dont_call_me
go-to: he_hugs_you

"Don't call me that."

"What?"

@im_fine_2
go-to: he_hugs_you

"I'm fine. I'm okay. Sorry."


@he_hugs_you

Suddenly, you feel a warmth around you. Physical contact. Oh. He's hugging you.

You feel paper on your face, wiping away your tears. You do not deserve this.

# TODO: elaborate this part?

- @done_rice: Anyway, the rice is done.

@wait_cooking

Your hands are idle. You feel as if you should be doing something.

- @cook_2: Prepare another dish.
- @entertain: Entertain S- somehow?
- @teach_s: Teach S- programming?

@entertain

S- is still leafing through the programming textbook.

- @play_game: Play a computer game?
- @watch_tv: Watch TV?

@play_game

"Do you want to, um, play a game?"

"Sure, why not?"

You turn on the computer. Are your usual games too violent for him? Probably. What games are suitable? Probably not any games about killing. Are there any educational games available that are not regime propaganda? You do not know.

- @no_idea_play_game: You have no idea what you are doing.

@no_idea_play_game

You have no idea what you are doing.

"Um, hello? Aunt Em?"

"Yeah... Sorry."

- @cry_1: Cry.

@watch_tv

"Do you want to, um, watch TV?"

"Sure, why not?"

You turn on the monitor. Currently playing on the public channel is a pre-election debate between representatives of the Ruling and Opposition parties.

- @turn_off_tv: Turn off the monitor.
- @play_game: Play a computer game?
- @teach_s: Teach S- programming?

@turn_off_tv

You turn off the monitor. S- has not been watching anyway.

- @done_rice: The rice is done.


@done_rice

The rice porridge is done cooking. You fill a bowl for S- and a bowl for yourself.

"How do you like it?", you ask.

"It's exactly like what mom makes."

"Oh. No surprise there. She taught me."

"You told me that already."

"Is it good, at least?"

He shrugs. "It's okay."

- @finish_meal: S- finishes the meal.


@finish_meal

S- finishes the meal, and so do you. It's getting close to his bedtime.

"I have to brush my teeth now."

"Do you have your own things?"

"Yeah. I brought my own toothbrush."

- @hug_s
- @bedtime: Bedtime.


@cook_2
choose-if: food >= 2
unavailable-subtitle: You do not have enough food.

It seems that you have enough stored food to make a small vegetable and meat stir fry dish. This is slightly more involved than cooking rice; you have to chop up the lettuce head and the dried tofu. Add oil to the heated pan, add the other ingredients, and stir. Your arms are tiring.

When you are about to take a break, you let the spatula go, and it clatters to the floor. Oil splashes on your hand. The floor is stained. What a pain.

"Can I help?", S- asks.

- @s_helps: Let him help.
- @s_no_help: No. You can do this.

@s_helps

"Sure. Help me wipe the floor."

He silently takes a paper towel and begins to wipe the oil. You wash the spatula, and finish cooking the dish.

"Thanks," you say. He shrugs.

- @eat_2: Eat.


@s_no_help

"No. It's fine."

Your body creaks as you bend downwards. "Are you sure you're fine?", S- asks.

- @not_fine: "No, I'm not."
- @im_fine: "(lie) Yes, I'm fine."
- @cry_1: Cry.

@not_fine

"No. I'm not fine."

"Then can I help you clean up?"

- @s_helps_2: Let him help.
- @cry_1: Cry.

@s_helps_2

He silently takes a paper towel and begins to wipe the oil. You wash the spatula, and finish cooking the dish.

"Thanks," you say. He shrugs.

"No problem."

- @eat_2: Eat.


@im_fine

"Yes. I'm fine."

"Are you sure?"

- @not_sure: "No. I'm not sure."


@not_sure

"No. I'm not sure." You let out a deep breath. "I'm not sure of anything, really."



@eat_2

"So, how's the food?", you ask.

"It tastes like what mom makes."

"Oh. Is that a good thing or a bad thing?"

"It's okay."

@bedtime

It is S-'s normal bedtime. You arrange some sheets on the floor, which is where you will sleep. S- is sleeping in your bed. You stay awake until you hear the regular rhythms of his breathing, and then you can finally sleep.
