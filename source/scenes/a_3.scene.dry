"So tell me," she asks, all of a sudden, "You know it's unsafe for us to meet like this, right?"

It is cold in the park by the frozen river, at least ten degrees colder than the rest of the undercity, and as a result there is almost no one else here. Finally your jacket is of practical use. A- is dressed more sensibly, too; she has dropped the tight black dress and thigh-high socks in exchange for a long coat and leggings.

A- has given you another $100, which she says has no relation to whether or not you wished to meet her again.

@transactional
on-arrival: money += 100

"All relationships are transactional. Love is a product of the mutually beneficial exchange of resources."

A- smirks. "Then if I pay you to love me, you would love me?"

You shrug. "The resources come first. The emotions can develop later. So... yes."

"Here's a hundred dollars, then." She is half-joking, or something like that. "Did your love for me increase?"

Neither of you are wearing masks, and no one else can be seen. So you lean into her. Guide her hands to your waist. Let her pull you closer. Your lips touch for a moment, before letting go.

"You don't understand what it's like. This is just my life. Maybe for you it's different. Maybe for you it's just a game. You can go home and just leave this behind. Leave me behind."

A- sighs, and puts an arm around your shoulder. "I don't think that's it. I... I really want this. I don't want to leave it all behind. Last time we met, I genuinely didn't even care if I got caught because it was just... it was just so empty. Like nothing mattered. And now, something does matter and I don't want to lose it..."

 A pause. A- holds you closer, tighter. "I'm worried. I'm worried about you and the future and... everything. Because I... fuck it, I still love you, okay?"

For some reason, there is a part of you that wants to laugh, because this scenario feels straight out of a drama, were it not for the fact of your identities.

# TODO: for now, maybe we'll have to shunt it out to the romance route.
# or maybe no non-romantic route? Maybe A- is using you. Maybe if she weren't in love with you, she wouldn't be even talking to you.

"We're in a state of mutually assured destruction, Em," she continues. "The Ruling Party is posting bounties for stealth laverneans, and anyone who's interacted with children while wearing opposite-sex clothing.

For whatever reason, the chemical pathways in your brain have decided that this moment would lead to laughter.

"Fuck, what did I do wrong?"

"Nothing! It's just... it's so dramatic."

"What's so dramatic?"

"Okay. You don't have to be. We don't have to define ourselves in such a stereotypical way."

"Then how would you define this?"

The next few moments are a blur. You get up, making sure to physically separate from A- as you walk to the trolley stop. The ride is tense with anxiety and anticipation. You are *afraid*, more so than you have been in a while. And then you are in your apartment.

"Huh. I've never been here before," says A-. "It's not a bad place. Small, but cozy."

"Thanks."

It is over. Your body aches. The two of you are squeezed side-by-side on the bed, naked under the sheets, facing each other. Your hand rests on her breast.

When you wake up, A- has already left the bed, and is sitting dressed in her "male" clothes.

"Sorry. I have to leave. There's... things I have to do."

@non_stuff
on-arrival: food += 1

You talk, of nothing in particular. A- has brought ingredients for a lentil curry, which she helps make with you. You had never remembered the recipe, but now you know, and it tastes good, so much better than anything you can make yourself. All the while, A- is touching you. You are touching so much.

- @main: She leaves, with a kiss.
