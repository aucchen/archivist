@game_1

You play a relatively recent game (from the current century). It is a text-based management game about surviving the Wilderness as a small Wanderer group, dealing with food, nanoplagues, and the like.

@game_2

You play a game recovered from the archives, from the pre-war era. It is a text-based game about high school dating and the drama involved therein.

@game_3

You play a game recovered from the archives, from the 3rd century. It is a political simulator that features loose stand-ins of the factions of that era, with virtually incomprehensible politics.

@game_4

You play a now-banned, formerly controversial game developed during the Uprising. It is a role playing game about a militarized polycule that does battle against the Guards and security forces, gaining experience as they kill more enemies. It was praised for having excellent lavernean representation, not a surprise given its development team, who are now mostly known to have died in the Uprising.

[? if games_played = 1 : You wonder if you could encode this game in DNA. ?]

@tv_1

Now playing is a film about a woman who disguises herself as a man to join the Guards during the Uprising. The villain is a lavernean with cartoonishly exaggerated features and a constantly visible bulge.

@tv_2

There is a speech by a Ruling Party politician. "We are the true heirs of the American Empire... We will not repeat the decadence and so-called toleration that led to the transhumanist order..." You tune out.

@tv_3

There is a debate between the Ruling Party and the Opposition Party.

You imagine the world of 500 years ago, the immediate pre-war era.

You imagine the world of the posthumans. What kind of civilization have they created in outer space? What are their stations and their houses? Do they still look human? Are their minds still recognizably human in any way?

Immediately after the war, the

Read the archives: read your saved DNA files.

go outside: it is rare that you venture outside your apartment without a specific purpose.
