You dream of K-, and A-. It is a memory, distorted by entropy.

"Do you love me?", A- muttered softly, not to you but to the woman on the other side of you. This was ten years ago, when you all resided in the EKA Residence Cube (K-'s neologism).

You were in the centre of the couch, with A- and K- on either side. Your arms and bodies were intertwined, K- and A- holding hands behind the back of your neck. K- played with your hair, and A- held your hand. At this time, the three of you were in what was typically called a "polycule". You were in love with each other, or something like that. You had a future, or something like that.

"That's an asinine question," K- said in her monotone voice. "Love is an illusion. The only purpose of love is the mutually beneficial exchange of resources."

- @dream_k_neoliberal: "That's awfully neoliberal of you."
- @dream_k_agree: "I agree. There is no such thing as love."
- @dream_k_silent: You remained silent.

@dream_k_neoliberal
go-to: dream_k_kropotkin

"That's awfully neoliberal of you," you said, with what you hoped was a degree of levity.

"It's not. A polycule is really just a form of mutual aid, like what Kropotkin said. We support each other. We pool together our resources to help us survive." She continued to twirl your hair around her finger.

@dream_k_kropotkin

"Who's Kropotkin?", asked A-.

"Pre-war philosopher," said K-. "Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution. They recently rediscovered his works in DNA."

"Sorry. I'm not into that sort of stuff."

K- sighed. "That's all your girlfriend's been talking about these days. You'd better at least pretend to be interested."

A- shrugged. "Sorry. Tell me when they've discovered something of practical use."

"They have," said K-. "The archivists were the generation that produced posthumans, after all. Their science was centuries ahead of ours."

- @dream_k_world: Just then, the emergency sirens started to ring.

@dream_k_agree
go-to: dream_k_kropotkin

"I agree. There is no such thing as love."

"Wow. You two ganging up against me again," said A-. "Why are you here, then? Why are you... together with me?"

"A polycule is just the most efficient way of delivering mutual aid. It's like what Kropotkin said."

@dream_k_silent
go-to: dream_k_kropotkin

You were silent.

"Do you really believe that?" A- asked K-. "Why are you here, then? Why are you... together with me?"

"A polycule is just the most efficient way of delivering mutual aid. It's like what Kropotkin said."


@dream_k_world

Just then, the emergency sirens started to ring. A harsh shrieking penetrated the walls of your apartment. It was the day of the Cataclysm, and everything hereafter would change.

- @dream_k_time_dilates: Time dilates...

@dream_k_time_dilates

Time dilates. The dream, or memory, accelerates. You put on your respirators, following the procedure every Arcology resident practice but never expected to implement. You gathered at the meeting points, made your way down to the undercity for the first and last time, lived in tents, watched others succumb to the nanoplagues, watched the confusion and cataclysm and strife and the search for scapegoats turn to *people like you*, whatever that means...

- @dream_k_end: Is this what happened?

@dream_k_end

Is this what happened?

- @dream_k_yes: Yes, it happened like this.
- @dream_k_no: No; it wasn't like this.
- @dream_k_idk: It doesn't matter.

@dream_k_yes

It happened like this, you think.

@dream_k_no

Of course it did not happen like this. The story is too clean, with an arc and juxtaposition that is all too convenient. True stories do not have arcs. They start and end with no lessons or morals.

@dream_k_idk

It doesn't matter, either way.

You dream of the uprising. It is not a product of your imagination, but a memory, distorted by entropy.

@dream_rev

It was the n-th day of the revolution, and you were bedridden, ensconced in your apartment with the curtains drawn so tightly that no light may enter or escape. You had electricity. You had running water. You had several months' worth of nonperishable food. You could begin to walk, one month following your surgery.

Life continued, as usual. Despite everything, despite the war raging on the ground, the lights outside continued their autonomic cycle, unbound by the mere mortal concerns of baseline humans.

- @you_were_fine: You were fine. Nothing was wrong.
- @but_heard: But you heard the explosions.
- @better_live: It was better to live on your knees than die on your feet.

@you_were_fine
go-to: surgical_revision

You were fine here. Nothing was wrong. They would not find you here. Contrary to your former comrades, you always hid your identity. None of your neighbours even knew your name.

@but_heard
go-to: surgical_revision

The explosions waxed and waned with each night and day, coming closer then retreating further away. Time was an illusion. In the cramped darkness of your apartment, the hours merged into a blur.

@better_live
go-to: surgical_revision

Contrary to the popular saying, it was in fact better to live on your knees than die on your feet. None of your former comrades would be convinced of that fact. Perhaps you were not, either. But you would live, and they would not.

@surgical_revision

Your most pressing problem was that you were supposed to have a follow-up appointment with your surgeon. Unfortunately, he was murdered by a mob for false allegations that he "forcibly castrated teenage boys". Propaganda works. Your painkiller prescriptions would never be refilled.

- @dream_rev_phone: You heard the phone ring.

@dream_rev_phone

You heard the phone ring.

- @dream_rev_answer: You answered it.


@dream_rev_answer

"Hey, Em?" K-'s voice. "Are you doing okay?"

- @hows_s: "How's S-?"
- @dream_im_fine: "I'm fine..."

@hows_s
go-to: k_continues

"How's S-?"

"He's awake. That's why I'm calling you so late." You heard the distant sounds of a toddler crying. You checked the clock. It was 1AM.

@dream_im_fine
go-to: k_continues

"I'm fine," you said.

"That's good. S- is awake. That's why I'm calling you so late." You heard the distant sounds of a toddler crying. You checked the clock. It was 1AM.

@k_continues

"How's your maintenance of homeostasis?" K- continued. "Can you walk yet? Can you pee without the catheter? Are you eating solid foods?"

- @nothings_wrong: "Nothing's wrong."

@nothings_wrong

"Nothing's wrong," you said, trying to believe it. "I can walk. I have food. I haven't removed the catheter yet."

"Seriously? It's been almost a month."

- @too_painful: "It's too painful."
- @clock_urine: "They'll read me from the sound of my urination."

@too_painful
go-to: clock_urine_2

"It's too painful," you said.

"Do you need help? I can come over and help you. If all else fails, call A-..."

- @clock_urine_2: "It's fine."

@clock_urine
go-to: clock_urine_2

"They'll read me from the sound of my urination," you said.

"That's fucking ridiculous."

"I read that even after surgery, the position of the urethra is slightly different, so they'll be able to tell from the sounds in the toilet bowl. I'm in a hostile neighbourhood. They all watch that show where they explain how to know when there's a pervert nearby."

An audible sigh. "Look, do you need help? I can come over and help you. If all else fails, can you call A-?"

- @clock_urine_2: "It's fine.
- @shoot_him: "Our people will probably shoot him."


@clock_urine_2

"It's fine. I can do it myself."

You heard the sounds of explosions through the phone.

"Shit," said K-. "S- is getting fussy. Say hi to your mom, will you? I have to go."

She hung up.

- @call_a: You called A-.
- @remove_c: You tried to remove the catheter yourself.

@shoot_him

"Our people will probably shoot him," you said.

"My god, is that still about the fucking desistance thing? Sure he's an asshole for those interviews, but-"

You heard the sounds of explosions through the phone.

"Shit," said K-. "S- is getting fussy. Say hi to your mom, will you? I have to go."

She hung up.

- @call_a: You called A-.
- @remove_c: You tried to remove the catheter yourself.
- @tried_sleep: You tried to sleep.

@call_a

Next, you called A-. There was no response, obviously given the hour. Unlike you or K-, he always kept to normal hours.

But then again, it's not as if he's responded to any of your attempts at contact recently.

- @dream_uprising_end: ...

@remove_c

You tried to remove the catheter yourself. You were taught the procedure. It should have been easy. It was fine. It worked. You lived.

- @dream_uprising_end: ...

@tried_sleep

You attempted to sleep. It was a way to conserve energy in an environment of energy scarcity. You were too cold to fall asleep, so instead you closed your eyes as you laid beneath your thin blankets.

- @dream_uprising_end: ...


@dream_uprising_end

Was any of this real?

- @dream_uprising_yes: Yes, it happened like this.
- @dream_uprising_no: No; it wasn't like this.
- @dream_uprising_idk: It doesn't matter.

@dream_uprising_yes

Did it really happen like this?

@dream_uprising_no

No, not exactly.

@dream_uprising_idk

It doesn't matter.

# TODO

You were living in a faraway land, in a far away time. Instead of the metal ceiling or even the translucent dome, there was a hazy unencumbered sky. Instead of the macroalgal trees there were genuine organisms of the phylum *Plantae*, photosynthesizing under a non-simulated sun.

You were surrounded by a forest of apartment towers, each one like its companions. You were on the rooftop of one of them, sitting with your friend (lover?), a boy (like you? What were you?).

"There are a number of surgeries I would like to undergo," you said, and pointed to your forehead. You were speaking an unfamiliar language, yet you understood every word. "First is the cranioplasty, to reduce the size of my brow ridges. Second is the genioplasty, to reduce these uncomfortable protrusions on my chin. These can be done together as part of a facial feminisation procedure. Of course, the other is... I'm too embarrassed to say it, of course."

- @you_laugh: You laughed.

@you_laugh

You laughed. Your companion smiled. He held you by the waist. "Do you think I could go, too?" they asked. "Of course!" you replied.

- @dream_l_end: The dream fades away.

@dream_l_end

The dream fades away, the images disappearing from your mind. When you wake, all that is left is an empty memory.

In the University's office, the Administrator watched, and the Psychologist listened.

"We understand that you've been having a difficult time lately," the Administrator began. "The transition to adulthood is always fraught, and it goes double for someone who grew up in tough circumstances. Many young males lash out, especially those with a history of gender identity like yours."

It was after the first time they discovered you, 20 years ago, and the words "gender identity" felt like ichor in your ears.

- @dream_a_die: You had tried to die.
- @dream_a_disappear: You had tried to disappear.
- @dream_a_slip: You were discovered barely conscious in your dorm room, without food for five days.

@dream_a_disappear
go-to: dream_a_die

@dream_a_slip
go-to: dream_a_die

@dream_a_die

The phrase "gender identity" had been discovered in the Buffalo Cache of fifty years prior, always adjacent to the words "cure" or "disorder" or "problem" or "issue". Learning the phrase was a revelation and a poison: *feelings* like yours were not unique, and for the sake of a rational society, your degeneracy must be abolished.

"Yes, we understand your problems with gender identity," said the Psychologist, brusquely. "I see a young man, a boy really, without a father figure to guide him to manhood. I see a boy who feels lonely and wants to belong to something, and thinks the way to do so is to indulge in his fantasies of living in a woman's skin and-"

The Administrator cut him off, too late. "Gender identity is a complicated issue, and there are many paths to... Never mind. The reason we have called you here is that..." She paused, and smiled gently.

- @dream_a_obvious: Any information you reveal can and will be used against you.

@dream_a_obvious

The Administrator continued, her voice soft and soothing, her facial gestures a simulacrum of empathy. "I think it's obvious to both of us that this environment is not a good place for you. It's not conducive to learning or socialization. We think it would be better for you, and for your classmates, if you took a break."

She expounded upon your litany of problems, your social isolation and gender identity disorder and self-harm. She explained that your scholarship was being withdrawn; even if the university would have you, you could not pay. She explained that you would be given five days to vacate the premises, and offered to "connect you to resources" to find a job or shelter. The weightless words faded away, and you could no longer comprehend their meaning.

"Do you have any questions?" The Administrator finally asked. This was your first opportunity to speak, but it was as if your mind was hollow.

- @dream_a_where: "Where am I supposed to go?"
- @dream_a_fuck_off: "Fuck off."
- @dream_a_leave: Just walk out.

@dream_a_where

"Where am I supposed to go?" You could barely muster the words.

"As I said, you'll have access to our external resources office for the next..."

You could not bear to listen anymore, and walked out. If it was important, you would hear about it; the office was stifling.

- @dream_a_meet_a: It was then that she saw you.

# Psychologist: "That is enough of an answer for me." He smiled, and you attempted to hide your grimace. "I see many young men like you, and you all have much in common. The same patterns of anomie and self-harm, the same sexual fetishes about inhabiting a woman's body. It severely impedes your ability to connect with normal people, those without your particular fetishes, does it not?"

# "So tell me," he continued, "what do you think of when you masturbate? Do you ever wear women's underwear while pleasuring yourself?"

#"I'm not telling you."

#"Too bad," he said. "Your sexual fantasies say a great deal about you. No matter. You are a well-trod specimen."

@dream_a_fuck_off

Anger. There was a part of you that still felt it. But you did not speak. You never could. Instead, you simply walked out without uttering a single word. You did not listen to the Administrator's parting words.

- @dream_a_meet_a: It was then that she saw you.

@dream_a_leave

You walked out without uttering another word. The Psychologist said something, and you did not listen.

- @dream_a_meet_a: It was then that she saw you.

@dream_a_meet_a

Her eyes caught yours as you exited the office.

"Are you a new inductee into the neogenic persisterhood?" She had stopped, and she was talking to you.

She was tall. She was beautiful. She was radiant, surrounded by a halo of light, the diffuse glow of the dome glinting off her curls. She was *smiling* at you, seemingly genuine. You wanted to distrust this stranger, but...

- @dream_a_maybe: "Maybe..."
- @dream_a_idk: "I don't know..."
- @dream_a_want: "I wish..."

"I wish..."

@dream_a_how_know

"How did you know...?"

She laughed, a sarcastic chortle. "Oh please. You don't go to *that* office looking like that without some, uh, problems." Another chuckle. You are conscious of your unruly long hair and loose clothing.

"What's your name?" she asked.

- @dream_a_em: "Em..."
- @dream_a_emmeline: "Emmeline..."
- @dream_a_name_idk: "I don't know yet..."

@dream_a_1_3

"Well, you won't get an answer from Dr. B. He fucking sucks." She laughed, a sarcastic chortle. "What's your name?"

- @dream_a_em: "Em..."
- @dream_a_emmeline: "Emmeline..."
- @dream_a_name_idk: "I don't know yet..."

@dream_a_em
go-to: dream_a_im_a

"I'm Em..." Short for Emmeline, of course, but no one needed to know that yet.

"My name's A-." She laughed again. "Nice to meet you, Em."

@dream_a_emmeline
go-to: dream_a_im_a

"I'm Emmeline..." You did not recall how the name becamed lodged in your mind, but you knew that it was *you*.

"My name's A-." She laughed again. "Nice to meet you, Emmeline."

@dream_a_name_idk
go-to: dream_a_im_a

"I don't know yet..." *What kind of an answer was that?*

"My name's A-." She laughed again. "You don't have to have everything decided yet. Nice to meet you."

@dream_a_im_a

She approached you, placing a hand on your shoulder. You instinctively recoiled, pushing her arm away.

"Oh, I'm so sorry!"

"It's okay..."

"No, I shouldn't have, I know a lot of us... well, if you are one of us, have sensitivities about these things." She smiled, and you could not bare to look. "Well, if you want to learn more about the persisters, or if you have any troubles at all, just contact me. I promise I can help."

You nodded, because that was all you could do. "Yeah, I'll... ask for help. If I need it."

- @dream_a_1_wake_up: And you did.

@dream_a_1_wake_up

And you did. Here is where time dilates, and your memories accelerate. You lived with her after getting expelled. For whatever reason, she became attached to you, and at some point the two of you seemlessly transitioned from a hand-holding friendship into dating. She was your first girlfriend. And somehow, she stayed with you even as she entered medical school, as one of the earliest neowomen to study medicine. Then K- encountered you, and then there were three, and then...

*Is this what happened?*

- @dream_a_yes: Yes, it happened like this.
- @dream_a_no: No; it wasn't like this.
- @dream_a_no_matter: It doesn't matter.

@dream_a_yes

Of course it did not happen like this. It was most likely a far more banal occasion.

It doesn't matter either way.

@dream_a_end

The Psychologist is alive. Based on actuarial statistics, he has outlived or will outlive every single neowoman who went through his program. He will outlive you.

*This is a dream. Or perhaps it is a memory.

You are living in a faraway land, in a far away time. Instead of the metal ceiling there is a hazy sky. Instead of the macroalgal trees there are genuine plants, photosynthesizing under a non-simulated sun.
