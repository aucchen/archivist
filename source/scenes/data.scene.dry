In the middle of the 21st century, when many believed (accurately) that civilization's collapse was imminent, a group of scientists undertook a mission to preserve human knowledge. They transcribed what they considered as the most important pieces of human knowledge into DNA, and transfected the DNA into specially engineered strains of E. coli and other bacteria. These strains were designed to outcompete existing bacterial populations, and to replicate and preserve the data-storage DNA plasmids with minimal mutations. The scientists then released their creations into the wild, via probiotic supplements among other means.

Today, it is estimated that 10% of E. coli populations in still-populated areas are used for DNA storage, as the technology was used repeatedly over the years, discovered and lost and discovered again.

Your job as DNA Data Archivist is to take the sequenced DNA datasets, the strings of A, T, G, and C, and turn them into human-readable information. You're pretty good at this, although it didn't stop the casualization of your employment.

The computer turns on, and the CRT monitor flickers to life. You open your e-mail. There are new data recovery and archival requests.

There is also a message from C-, your coworker-turned supervisor.

`Hi Em,

Sorry about the job title change. You're still a valuable contributor to our team, although your output has slid recently. We believe that a more flexible position will be better for both your interests and ours. You don't have to work yourself beyond your physical or mental means. Just do what you can.`

`Best,
C-.`

First, it is to test our DNA synthesis methods, and to test our different encoding schemes, as well as both in vivo and in vitro storage methodologies and media. Second, it is a precursor to a much more substantial project, the DNA Time Capsule project, wherein we will store the entireties of several major sources of human knowledge in DNA.`

`The process of writing these diaries allows for me to explore thoughts and aspects of myself that I have been deeply reluctant to express. In particular, I will turn to the perhaps tired question of my own trans identity.`

`Yingmei has lived most of her life as a woman, and I am close, but there are still worries and doubts I have, connecting me like a tether to the years before.

For a substantial period of time, I wondered if I was correct to feel this way. When we look to the past, will we find exemplars of or justifications for our existence? Our detractors and some of our allies say that we, as trans lesbians, are creatures unmoored from time and tradition, people without precedent, an ahistorical anomaly at best, a mentally ill predatory abomination at worst. We are a people without a history, they say, except some revisionist vestiges, a postmodern invention of a few doctors, a meme gone wrong.

But I don't care about any of this.

I am a posthuman because I want to cut away all of the tethers chaining us to the arbitrary circumstances of our birth, to give us true freedom down to the molecular scale. Everything Yingmei and I have built is for this goal. We will almost certainly fail, but there is no other path.

Jiaren does not occur in the historical record; the Founder's personal relationships were unknown, and she was assumed to have a husband. If this is true, then, as some revisionist pseudohistorians have suggested, Liana was indeed a lesbian, and not only that, but also have a partner who was the historical equivalent of a neowoman (probably).

However, the likelihood of this discovery being believed is approximately zero.

Unfortunately, the importance of a document does not necessarily correlate with its likelihood of preservation. This is especially true in this document class; in all their wisdom the pre-war scientists never cared to duplicate copies of the most central articles in this encyclopedia, instead simply shotgun-encoding the entire encyclopedia into a bacterial colony. Due to various biological factors, shorter sequences and thus shorter articles were more likely to successfully replicate, thus leading to the proliferation of small and seemingly insignificant articles

Hello from the distant past. If you are reading this, it is likely that you are in New Niagara Arcology. Since technology apparently is still advanced enough to decode DNA, your society must be flourishing, or at least stable. Is it not?

It is my last few weeks on Earth, before I am required to leave for the space colonies as stipulated by the Posthuman Treaty. During this time, I am supervising the construction of the Arcology, also as stipulated by the Treaty. I am ensuring that the environmental seal and filtration systems will allow the city to remain free of the nanoplagues that were the most unfortunate consequence of the war.

I have attached some schematics on the design and maintenance of some of these filtration systems. I hope the information contained herein will be helpful.

In case you are interested in ancient history, I have written a small sample of my diaries in *Lactobacillus* colonies that have already been distributed throughout the city.

I've attached a key for the next entry. Each of my diaries will have a key to the next entry, to prevent them from being read out of order.

`What is there to know about me? My name is Liana Yingmei Xu, or \[WARNING: UNKNOWN CHARACTER ENCODING\]. I was born in Shijiazhuang, Hebei Province, People's Republic of China. Do you know where that is? Does the memory of China still exist in your time?

I emigrated to America to study biophysics and biochemistry, and I have worked in a variety of scientific positions. I am married to my wife, Jiaren Qi, also of Shijiazhuang, and we had two children.

# Now I will tell the story of how my wife and I got together. :) (see this? this is a "smiley face emoji".)

Jiaren and I grew up in the same town and went to the same high school. I was notorious among my classmates for being a crossdresser, for wearing girl's outfits whenever I had the opportunity. They would see me at the mall, and they would go, that is not a beautiful girl, that is our classmate Xu ---!

Jiaren was the one person who drew closer to me despite these (true) rumors. He (because Jiaren was still a boy back then) was the only person who asked me if I would rather be treated as a boy or a girl. I fell in love with Jiaren, and I believe she realized so, but of course nothing came of it.

Do the equivalents of people such as us still exist in your era?

Relatedly, how are posthumans thought of these days? Are we still considered monsters? Or has the distinction between baselines and posthumans re-emerged? It cannot be so inconceivable, given the presence of DNA sequencing technology.

Here is a picture of me. A poor picture. And here is a sample of my voice.

 There is an unknown character encoding here. There is a blurred, heavily dithered image of a person; you can tell that it is a face, but not much more than that. The voice sample is degraded but still audible; it repeats the first paragraph of this diary entry.

If this diary were at all true, then this is an indication that Liana and her partner were both neowomen (or the historical equivalent of neowomen, not that historians would ever agree such a thing existed). This is a potentially monumentous discovery. Your movement had already adopted Liana Xu as a symbol, but they were never aware that she was *actually* like them.
 
As to her questions about her old country and posthumans, they are rarely thought of at all.

`I suppose these are my memoirs, abbreviated to fit inside a single microbe.

The next chapter of my story is moving to America for university, and then graduate school. Does the memory of America still exist in your time?

I was privileged in that I had parents who would pay for me to take my tests, but the only way we could afford an American university was through scholarships. I hope this is not too self-aggrandizing, but I was a good student. I studied science, especially biology. When I was younger I thought that if I developed the technology to change every chromosome in my body, I could become a "real woman". Of course, I soon learned that such a technology would be less effective at altering my anatomy than the standard hormone therapy.

What I learned was that the biochemistry of hormonal transition indelibly etches itself into every cell of your body. It sculpts the Waddington landscape of cellular development, carving out new valleys and paths like a fast-moving stream. Your body reconfigures itself. You become new. My physiology was crossing an unmarked boundary, just as it was crossing an ocean and a very marked boundary into a new country.

University in America was not the revelation I thought it would be. I heard that it was a haven for *people like us*, but in truth those like us were still few and isolated. Eventually, Jiaren came to America too, and we reunited one day. We fell in love again. She (because by that time she was also beginning to transition) and I eventually married and, well, the rest of the story will come later.

`We were now on our third adopted homeland. We thought we would be forced to flee because of discrimination for our gender, not because of an absurd war between our two previous homelands. They called it the Sino-American War, or sometimes the Third World War. Does memory of the war still exist in your time? Or has it been entirely eclipsed by the Posthuman War? It was certainly not as destructive, with "only" tens to hundreds of thousands killed.

It is here that Jiaren convinced me to have the procedure done. By this time it was not such a difficult process, technically speaking. On the cellular side, all it took were some induced pluripotent stem cells and carefully tuned gene regulatory induction systems, easy ever since our advanced simulations. We grew the uterus via tissue culture. The more difficult portion was the physical trans/implant. But it was not my first such surgery, obviously.

Our first child was born via surrogacy. Our second child was born via my body, and the culmination of decades of bioengineering.

How are you today? We are currently assembling the organics recycling system, which involved a level of microbiotic engineering on par with the artificial womb system :). It will allow your city to produce hydrocarbons from any organic feedstock, for energy or in the manufacture of chemicals and materials.

# Liana 5 - [the war]

`I wonder what you would call the war in your time?

Some called it World War 3. Others called it World War 4, because the Sino-American war was already World War 3. I was, as you obviously know, a posthuman, so my side in the war was clear, despite my misgivings about some of the factions on our side. It was a fratricidal, even omnicidal war at times. Our spokespersons said that we were fighting for liberation and bodily autonomy. The baseline leaders claimed to be fighting for the preservation of humanity.

One tidbit you will not find in your baseline histories is how trans people were treated in the war. The conflation of "transgender" or "transsexual" with "transhuman" made all trans people in baseline territories into enemies. There were purges and imprisonments and killings, more so than usual. Even those who sympathized with the baseline cause ended up on the posthuman side.

My greatest regret was how I could not prevent my son from joining the war. He was a nanoplague designer for the Analysts. Perhaps those words mean nothing to you? He was responsible for the deaths of millions.

And what about you, I wonder, presumed baseline? Did trans-ness reemerge? Are there people like us in your world?

You have no idea what to feel about this. All respectable historians would discount the connections between the pre-war "transsexuals" and the modern "neogens". No one saw the transsexuals as women, and they did not claim to be so, as go the respectable histories.

`You might be more familiar with intra-baseline politics of the war, but the posthumans were hardly unified either. The Analysts were our largest faction. Naturally, they believed that any future society must be rationally organized, and that the posthumans had the computational apparatus necessary to implement the best possible society for the baselines. All who disagreed with them, me included, were part of the very loosely defined Coalition. You see, there was no place for something as messy as transsexuality in the Analysts' rationally organized society, and I had some fading irrational attachment to my mortal ideals.

The trouble was that my son was a supporter of the Analysts. He rose to their leadership on the basis of his nanoplague designs. The Analysts and the Coalition had not directly engaged in strife, but the Analysts took the lead on committing atrocities to cow the baseline populace. They had a whole litany of justifications, including that by making the neohumans to be the baselines' perpetual villain, a more stable society would develop in the aftermath, one free from wars amongst each other.

 I killed him, of course. It was done with a nanoplague specifically keyed to his genome - his favorite weapon. The rest of the Analysts quickly became pliant, after updating their game-theoretic model of my behavior. Afterwards, we signed the Treaty stipulating non-interference in baseline affairs (although one might consider this document a form of interference, I know that the Analysts have placed their own data caches in your city).

 Anyway, it will soon be time for me to leave this city. So long. I hope we can see each other soon.

`Robust direct digital-to-biological data storage in living cells`

`Abstract: DNA has been the predominant information storage medium for biology and holds great promise as a next-generation high-density data medium in the digital era. Currently, the vast majority of DNA-based data storage approaches rely on in vitro DNA synthesis. As such, there are limited methods to encode digital data into the chromosomes of living cells in a single step. Here, we describe a new electrogenetic framework for direct storage of digital data in living cells. [...] We demonstrate multiplex data encoding into barcoded cell populations to yield meaningful information storage and capacity up to 72 bits, which can be maintained over many generations in natural open environments...`

`CRISPR–Cas encoding of a digital movie into the genomes of a population of living bacteria`

`Abstract: DNA is an excellent medium for archiving data. Recent efforts have illustrated the potential for information storage in DNA using synthesized oligonucleotides assembled in vitro. A relatively unexplored avenue of information storage in DNA is the ability to write information into the genome of a living cell by the addition of nucleotides over time. Using the Cas1–Cas2 integrase, the CRISPR–Cas microbial immune system stores the nucleotide content of invading viruses to confer adaptive immunity. When harnessed, this system has the potential to write arbitrary information into the genome. Here we use the CRISPR–Cas system to encode the pixel values of black and white images and a short movie into the genomes of a population of living bacteria...`

`In vivo processing of digital information molecularly with targeted specificity and robust reliability`

`Abstract: DNA has attracted increasing interest as an appealing medium for information storage. However, target-specific rewriting of the digital data stored in intracellular DNA remains a grand challenge because the highly repetitive nature and uneven guanine-cytosine content render the encoded DNA sequences poorly compatible with endogenous ones. In this study, a dual-plasmid system based on gene editing tools was introduced into Escherichia coli to process information accurately. Digital data containing large repeat units in binary codes, such as text, codebook, or image, were involved in the realization of target-specific rewriting in vivo, yielding up to 94% rewriting reliability. An optical reporter was introduced as an advanced tool for presenting data processing at the molecular level. Rewritten information was stored stably and amplified over hundreds of generations. Our work demonstrates a digital-to-biological information processing approach for highly efficient data storage, amplification, and rewriting, thus robustly promoting the application of DNA-based information technology.`

`Robust Chemical Preservation of Digital Information on DNA in Silica with Error-Correcting Codes`

`Abstract: Information, such as text printed on paper or images projected onto microfilm, can survive for over 500 years. However, the storage of digital information for time frames exceeding 50 years is challenging. Here we show that digital information can be stored on DNA and recovered without errors for considerably longer time frames. To allow for the perfect recovery of the information, we encapsulate the DNA in an inorganic matrix, and employ error-correcting codes to correct storage-related errors. Specifically, we translated 83 kB of information to 4991 DNA segments, each 158 nucleotides long, which were encapsulated in silica. Accelerated aging experiments were performed to measure DNA decay kinetics, which show that data can be archived on DNA for millennia under a wide range of conditions. The original information could be recovered error free, even after treating the DNA in silica at 70 °C for one week. This is thermally equivalent to storing information on DNA in central Europe for 2000 years.`

`An Empirical Comparison of Preservation Methods for Synthetic DNA Data Storage`

`Abstract: Synthetic DNA has recently risen as a viable alternative for long-term digital data storage. To ensure that information is safely recovered after storage, it is essential to appropriately preserve the physical DNA molecules encoding the data. While preservation of biological DNA has been studied previously, synthetic DNA differs in that it is typically much shorter in length, it has different sequence profiles with fewer, if any, repeats (or homopolymers), and it has different contaminants. In this paper, nine different methods used to preserve data files encoded in synthetic DNA are evaluated by accelerated aging of nearly 29 000 DNA sequences. In addition to a molecular count comparison, the DNA is also sequenced and analyzed after aging. These findings show that errors and erasures are stochastic and show no practical distribution difference between preservation methods. Finally, the physical density of these methods is compared and a stability versus density trade-offs discussion provided.`


@s505_c

This paper describes how long DNA storage methods might last. This sequence was likely first synthesized at least 470 years ago (unless the False Century school is true), so its preservation was a success.

The first century is something of a dark age when it comes to history, most likely owing to the fact that the government of the time moved all of their official records to DNA storage, and DNA decoding technology was lost until the past two decades. It seems to have been an era of violence, strife, and popular mysticism. It is interesting how DNA storage correlates with "Dark Ages" in arcology history (including the present day).

The Negationists believed that posthumans were the cause of the War, and that they inflicted violent cruelties upon the baselines. The Negationists appear to have won out in this conflict.

`An excerpt from the revolutionists' manifesto:

Our city is a landscape of ever-increasing suffering and terror. Half of the city is burnt. We starve and thirst in the cold, tens of thousands of us without homes. Nanoplagues rampage uncontrolled, as we die younger each year. Even our bodies have become properties of the Ruling Party and its corporate affiliates. We do not have the freedom to live.

The coup ended the illusion that the ruling class would tolerate democratic change. Innocent women and men have been slaughtered by the vile cruelty of the Guards, those enforcers of capital.

We demand:

 - restoration of civil rule, and immediate free elections for the Council.
 - an immediate relief program for all made homeless or unemployed during the Cataclysm.
 - an immediate halt to residential evictions.
 - democratic control of the means of production, in the hands of the workers.
 -...

 (and so on, and so on. it's quite boring, really)

 ---

 This manifesto is not worth the DNA it is printed on, of course. Here are some examples of reactions from movements we hoped would be allied:

 ---

 A statement by the Socialist-Labour faction:

 The Socialist Party and the Labour League deplore the misappropriation of socialist imagery and phrases by the recent "uprising". The purveyors of bourgeois identity politics are misappropriating socialist rhetoric to lend legitimacy to their deviance. While we are strongly opposed to the coup and urge the restoration of democracy, we do not support the violent so-called uprising.

 ---

 A statement by the Niagara Women's Convention:

 The Niagara Women's Convention stands strongly in opposition to the violent activists of the so-called uprising. The neo-"women" movement is fundamentally anti-feminist, as they seek to erase the biological distinctiveness of women, and functionally provide a conduit for predatory males to infiltrate female spaces. This petulant "uprising" only further shows the inherent male violence exhibited by neo-"women".`

 ---

`Let it be known first of all that I opposed launching the revolution. We had no allies - how could we when the Ruling Party and every media organ in the city has been propagandizing about how we were sexual degenerates for the past ten years? Ten thousand angry sisters did not constitute a mass movement. We had few arms, no training after being excluded from the security services, few financial resources, nearly no allies.`

`But what choice do we have? We either accept the aid of all who offer it, or we perish. Regardless, we have been doing quite a bit of that lately.`

`A recounting of a conversation:

 Leon: We're not fucking going down with this ship.

 Me: It's interesting how language works, isn't it? None of us have seen a ship before but the idiom still exists in our collective memories.

 Leon: Fuck off. My point is, the writing's already on the wall.

 Me: Another interesting turn of phrase.

 Leon: Fuck. Off. The revolution is over. We can either live to fight another day, or we can die like the rest of them. I know you're one of the more pragmatic ones here, not like the fanatics. We have to go underground. Hide. Do anything but keep on going like this. The undercity's a big place.
 
 Me: Do you think someone who looks like me can live openly ever again?
 
 Leon: That's the point of the historicide, isn't it?

 Me: I'm not a deserter. Maybe we can bring it to a vote-`

`At that moment we were interrupted, and Leon went back to his duties. So. In truth I do not know what I should do. I do not want to die, and I can see that our current path leads to no other outcome but mass death. I think I can convince the rest of our brigade to shift our tactics from open battle to underground resistance while maintaining our civilian identities and hiding among the general populace. Of course there is a chance I'll get purged for making such a suggestion. And even if we go underground, we might find our civilian identities unusable.`

`Here is what happened:

We were hiding in a safehouse, watching a patrol of Guards. They had dragged a woman out of the neighbouring apartment. They must have thought she was a neowoman, because she was tall and broad-shouldered, but maybe they were wrong. They couldn't always tell, and rarely cared. 

She was crying, struggling, trying to pull away, but there were too many of them. They were trying to pull down her pants, and they laughed as they did so. Something in me broke right then.

I wanted to fire. The squad leader shook her head. I fired anyway. I killed the man. His colleague put a bullet in the woman's head. We exchanged bullets. More guards dropped dead. A few survivors fled. None of us in the Unity Regiment were hurt.

Was this a victory? What did we gain? Our commander admonished me for betraying our location, for burning one more safehouse. We won the battle, but I took us one step closer to losing the war. I couldn't even save her. I couldn't even save one life. And all the revolutionary struggle in the world will not bring that anonymous person back.

Cygne is trying to comfort me right now. They say that writing it down will make it better. All it has done is made me realize what a waste this all is.

# Since our history will be destroyed, it might be useful for future historians to have a timeline of recent events that have affected our community:

# At the beginning, of course, was the cataclysm. I doubt any of this would have happened were it not for its impact. However, the seeds for persecution were laid long before, perhaps even from the dawn of human history. But here is where the recent history starts:

# 4 BC (before the cataclysm - I have no idea if this calendar will come into use but it should): "NeoCrimes" column on CityNet begins broadcasting, referencing. This becomes one of the most popular columns on CityNet.

# - Ruling party passes bill to ban neowomen from athletics, owing to "unfairness", provoked by an example of a neofemale weightlifter achieving a historical competitive record among women weighing between the ages of 36 and 46 weighing between 55 and 75 kilograms who were born in the West Side. Only ten known athletes were affected by the policy due to the preexisting underrepresentation of neowomen in sports, so it was largely ignored by the community.

# You know what? I can't keep writing. This is too absurd. A single sister winning an obscure competition leads to genocide. Fuck this.

# - Rosa Camacho, Bread and Roses Brigade

# - this is when I first began crossing. The fact is largely irrelevant, but it is here for context.

# 2 AC:

# - Ruling party passes bill to prevent any access to "neosexual" hormone treatments or surgery by those under 18.

# - Ruling party considers, does not yet pass bills to ban neowomen from using women's washrooms, as well as bills to ban neowomen from professions with contact with children due to fears of 

# - in response to fabricated reports of 

# - "Washroom bill" bans all neowomen from using women's public facilities if they have not had hormones and surgery, or if their presence makes GNT women "uncomfortable". Enforcement was uneven.

# 3 AC:

# - Anti-nonbinary purges in teaching: in response to media reports of nonbinary teachers presenting sexualized content, schools were prevented from introducing "age-inappropriate" topics of gender or sexuality. In practice, open or "non-passing" neowomen are de facto prevented from becoming teachers, as their presence was inherently sexual and would supposedly "confuse" children. Enforcement was uneven.

# - Anti-nonbinary purges in medicine: in response to a supposed incident where a GNT woman was made uncomfortable by the presence of a neofemale nurse, hospitals throughout the city begin firing visible neowomen staff. This happened unevenly; plenty of neowomen are unaffected. Unions vow to resist in the name of solidarity, do not (also in the name of solidarity, but with GNT women).

# - Anti-nonbinary policy in insurance: any public or private insurance coverage of "mutilating" procedures that "have no health necessity" is prohibited, most notably banning coverage of crossing-related hormone therapy and surgery. Fortunately, we had mutual aid networks and unauthorized biochem labs, and many were able to access hormones via non-standard prescriptions.
