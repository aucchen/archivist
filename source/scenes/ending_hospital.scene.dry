You awake in a hospital, in an unfamiliar bed, dressed in a blue gown, IV drip from your wrist. The window is dark. The interior lights are too bright.

C- is here. It is the first time you have seen her since... since before your illness. She is more than ten years younger than you, and looks the part.

"Hey, Em. Sorry you got sick. I guess it's partly my fault for pushing you."

- @still_job: "Can I keep my job?"
- @not_your_fault: "It's not your fault."
- @okay: "Okay..."

"Can I keep my job?"

"Yes. Of course you can keep your job." She sighs. "I'll try to find you something more permanent and less subject to scrutiny."

@not_your_fault
go-to: archives_c

"It's not your fault."

She sighs. "It kind of is. I should've known how sick you really were."

@okay
go-to: archives_c

"Okay..."


@archives_c

"I hope you continue working with the Archives, despite everything," she continues. "I don't think we're *that* evil. What we're doing is important, and more importantly, interesting."

# TODO: introduce Lyra and Altair?
# The hospital door opens, and two more people enter.

- @ending_c: "Yes, I'll continue working here."
- @working: You don't have any other options, do you?

"Yes, I'll continue working here."

"Great! You know you're one of the best DNA archivists we have, right? To be fair we only have about five, including us, but..." C- shakes her head. "Just, take it easy, okay? I'll try to not send you to the hospital anymore."

- @ending_c_epilogue: End.

= End

Unfortunately, you still have a host of other troubles. Your illness will return. Your rent is still rising, with the eventual goal of your eviction.

But those are problems for another day. At least you still have a job, and at least one human with concern for your well-being. Maybe C- can help with rent.
