@who_was

He was your former partner, eight years ago, and used to live as a neowoman like you. He, K- and you used to be the closest of friends and lovers, or something like that, until pressures in the medical field forced A- to choose between living openly as a neowoman and having a high-paying career. He chose the latter. You broke up. K- still has a grudge.

"Hello, Em?"

"Hi."

"I heard you've been having trouble with rent. Is there anything I can do to help?"

- @how_know: "How did you know?"
- @pay_rent: "You can help me pay rent..."

@how_know

"How did you know I've been having trouble?"

"Oh, I've been following your profile on the Archives' CityNet page. Your profile was removed, so I guessed that you've been fired."

- @thats_creepy: "That's creepy."
- @pay_rent: "You can help me pay rent..."


@thats_creepy

"That's creepy."

"Sorry. But can I still help?"

- @dont_want_help: "Actually, I don't want your help."
- @pay_rent: "You can help me pay rent..."


@dont_want_help

"Actually, I don't want your help."

"Are you sure? Don't worry about me. I have enough money to help you."

- @dont_want_2: "Yes, I'm sure."
- @pay_rent: "You can help me pay rent..."


@dont_want_2

"Yes, I'm sure. I don't want your help."

"Oh. Okay. Well, I still really want to see you again. So if you change your mind or if you want to hang out, just let me know."

"Okay."

A- hangs up, leaving you alone with your thoughts.


@pay_rent

"You can help me pay rent..."

"Right. How much do you need?"

- @100: $100 to cover rent.
- @200: $200 more to cover rent.
- @300: $300 for rent.

"Sure, anything for you," A- says. "Anyway, could we possibly meet again soon? I really want to see you again."

- @okay_see: "Okay..."
- @maybe_see: "Maybe..."
- @precondition: "Is that a condition for the money?"

@precondition

"Is that a condition for the money?"

"No, of course not!" An audible sigh. "I just want to see you. Is it okay?"

It doesn't feel right to refuse.

- @okay_see: "Okay..."
- @maybe_see: "Maybe..."
- @idk_see: "I don't know..."

@okay_see

"Okay..."

"That's great! Maybe we could meet up at Founders Square again, and wander around the city just like the old days."

"Yeah, maybe."

"Well, call me if you want to meet up, or if you need anything else!"

- @done: A- hangs up.


@maybe_see

"Um, maybe," you say. "I'm..."

"No, it's fine," he says. "I understand if you don't want to see me."

"It's not that, it's... just..." You don't know what to say.

"Well, then, just call me if you want to meet up, or if you need anything else."

- @done: A- hangs up.

@idk_see

"Um, I don't know," you say.

"That's fine," he says. "I understand if you don't want to see me."

"It's not that, it's... just..." You don't know what to say.

"Well, then, just call me if you want to meet up, or if you need anything else."

- @done: A- hangs up.


@done

A- hangs up, leaving you alone with your thoughts. At least you are slightly further from total destitution.
