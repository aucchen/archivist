Digital data containing large repeat units in binary codes, such as text, codebook, or image, were involved in the realization of target-specific rewriting in vivo, yielding up to 94% rewriting reliability. An optical reporter was introduced as an advanced tool for presenting data processing at the molecular level. Rewritten information was stored stably and amplified over hundreds of generations.

To allow for the perfect recovery of the information, we encapsulate the DNA in an inorganic matrix, and employ error-correcting codes to correct storage-related errors. Specifically, we translated 83 kB of information to 4991 DNA segments, each 158 nucleotides long, which were encapsulated in silica. Accelerated aging experiments were performed to measure DNA decay kinetics, which show that data can be archived on DNA for millennia under a wide range of conditions. The original information could be recovered error free, even after treating the DNA in silica at 70 °C for one week. This is thermally equivalent to storing information on DNA in central Europe for 2000 years.\"}}]},\"data.s404_c\":{\"id\":\"data.s404_c\",\"goTo\":[{\"id\":\"data.todo\"}],\"content\":{\"content\":\"You have learned how to implement the decoding method described in this paper.

To ensure that information is safely recovered after storage, it is essential to appropriately preserve the physical DNA molecules encoding the data. While preservation of biological DNA has been studied previously, synthetic DNA differs in that it is typically much shorter in length, it has different sequence profiles with fewer, if any, repeats (or homopolymers), and it has different contaminants. In this paper, nine different methods used to preserve data files encoded in synthetic DNA are evaluated by accelerated aging of nearly 29 000 DNA sequences. In addition to a molecular count comparison, the DNA is also sequenced and analyzed after aging. These findings show that errors and erasures are stochastic and show no practical distribution difference between preservation methods. Finally, the physical density of these methods is compared and a stability versus density trade-offs discussion provided.\"}}]},\"data.s505_c\":{\"id\":\"data.s505_c\",\"goTo\":[{\"id\":\"data.todo\"}],\"content\":{\"content\":\"This paper describes how long DNA storage methods might last.
